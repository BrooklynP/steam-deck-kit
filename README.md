# Stream Deck Kit

This is a collection of batch files that can be edited and then run through both a .net app GUI aswell as opening the apps on an elgato stream deck in order to improve productivity. Essentially an advanced set of macros. The batch files perform programming tasks that I use on a regular basis such as git push, code . , ng serve etc.
